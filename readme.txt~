Make a git repository for the gollum wiki.  Then commit and push the contents.  See what you can play with.  

So, the gollum wiki works pretty well.  The html that LaTeX produces can be fairly well translated, however, it doesn't deal correctly with png images.  Also there are a few notations left <- that stay in and look silly.  Links work, though.  

So, an older version of PmagPy (WebPmagPy) works on the wiki, but with no images.  A newer version PmagPy doesn't work at all, just errors.  Not sure how to translate html into markdown, or a format that this wiki will take.
